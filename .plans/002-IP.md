# Custom Domain & Blog Subscription - Implementation Plan

**Master Plan:** `.plans/002-MP.md`
**Date:** 2025-12-25

---

## Overview

This implementation plan provides file-by-file code changes for configuring a custom domain (nicharena.com) on GitHub Pages and adding email subscriptions via Buttondown.

**Buttondown username:** `nicharena`

> **Post-MVP Addition (2025-12-25):** Tickets #7 and #8 were added after initial implementation to enable automated email notifications via RSS-to-email. These were not part of the original master plan.

---

## Proposed Structure

### Guiding Principles
- Use existing CSS variables for consistent styling
- Keep form simple - Buttondown handles everything server-side
- No JavaScript required for form submission
- Maintain dark/light mode compatibility

---

## File-by-File Change List

### File 1: `CNAME` (new)

**Path:** `/CNAME`

**Change:** Create new file in repository root.

```
nicharena.com
```

**Why:** GitHub Pages requires a CNAME file to serve the site at a custom domain. This file tells GitHub which domain to associate with the repository.

---

### File 2: `astro.config.mjs` (modify)

**Path:** `/astro.config.mjs`

**Change:** Update site URL from GitHub Pages subdomain to custom domain.

**Before:**
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://niarenaw.github.io',
```

**After:**
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://nicharena.com',
```

**Why:** Astro uses the `site` config for generating canonical URLs, sitemaps, and RSS feeds. Must match the actual deployed domain.

---

### File 3: `src/components/SubscribeForm.astro` (new)

**Path:** `/src/components/SubscribeForm.astro`

**Change:** Create new component for email subscription form.

```astro
---
// SubscribeForm.astro
// Email subscription form using Buttondown
---

<section class="mt-16 pt-8 border-t border-[var(--color-border)]">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-[var(--color-accent)]">
        Subscribe
    </h2>
    <p class="text-[var(--color-text-muted)] mb-4">
        Get notified when I publish new posts. No spam, unsubscribe anytime.
    </p>
    <form
        action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/nicharena"
        method="post"
        class="flex gap-3"
    >
        <input
            type="email"
            name="email"
            placeholder="your@email.com"
            required
            class="flex-1 px-4 py-2 rounded-lg border border-[var(--color-border)] bg-[var(--color-bg)] text-[var(--color-text)] placeholder-[var(--color-text-muted)] focus:outline-none focus:border-[var(--color-accent)]"
        />
        <button
            type="submit"
            class="px-6 py-2 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-accent)] text-white font-medium hover:bg-[var(--color-accent-hover)] transition-colors"
        >
            Subscribe
        </button>
    </form>
</section>
```

**Why:**
- Uses Buttondown's embed form POST endpoint - no backend needed
- Styled with existing CSS variables for dark/light mode support
- Flexbox layout keeps input and button on same line
- Form submits directly to Buttondown, which handles confirmation emails

---

### File 4: `src/pages/blog/index.astro` (modify)

**Path:** `/src/pages/blog/index.astro`

**Change:** Import and add SubscribeForm component below post list.

**Before (lines 1-4):**
```astro
---
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";
import BaseLayout from "../../layouts/BaseLayout.astro";
```

**After (lines 1-5):**
```astro
---
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";
import BaseLayout from "../../layouts/BaseLayout.astro";
import SubscribeForm from "../../components/SubscribeForm.astro";
```

**Before (lines 60-65):**
```astro
                </ul>
            )
        }
    </div>
</BaseLayout>
```

**After (lines 60-67):**
```astro
                </ul>
            )
        }

        <SubscribeForm />
    </div>
</BaseLayout>
```

**Why:** Places subscription form at the bottom of the blog index page, after the post list. The form appears in context where readers are already browsing content.

---

### File 5: `README.md` (modify)

**Path:** `/README.md`

**Change:** Add notification workflow documentation section.

**Append to end of file:**

```markdown

## Notifying Subscribers

When publishing a **new** blog post (not edits to existing posts):

1. Push the new post to `main` branch
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Go to [Buttondown dashboard](https://buttondown.email/emails)
4. Click "New email"
5. Write notification:
   ```
   Subject: New post: [Post Title]

   Body:
   I just published a new post: [Post Title]

   [Brief 1-2 sentence description]

   Read it here: https://nicharena.com/blog/[slug]
   ```
6. Preview and send

**Important:** Only notify for new posts. Edits to existing posts (typos, clarifications) do not warrant notifications.
```

**Why:** Documents the manual notification workflow. Explicitly states that only new posts trigger notifications - edits don't spam subscribers.

---

### File 6: `src/pages/rss.xml.js` (new) — *Added in Ticket #7*

**Path:** `/src/pages/rss.xml.js`

**Change:** Create RSS feed endpoint for blog posts.

```javascript
import rss from '@astrojs/rss';
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';

export async function GET(context) {
  const posts = await getCollection('blog', ({ data }) => !data.draft);

  return rss({
    title: 'Nich Arena',
    description: 'Blog posts about my learnings - mostly math.',
    site: context.site,
    items: posts
      .sort((a, b) => b.data.pubDate.valueOf() - a.data.pubDate.valueOf())
      .map((post) => ({
        title: post.data.title,
        pubDate: post.data.pubDate,
        description: post.data.description,
        link: `/blog/${post.id}/`,
      })),
  });
}
```

**Why:**
- Generates RSS feed at `https://nicharena.com/rss.xml`
- Required for Buttondown's RSS-to-email automation
- Filters out drafts, sorts by date descending (newest first)
- Uses site URL from `astro.config.mjs`

---

### File 7: `README.md` (modify) — *Updated in Ticket #8*

**Path:** `/README.md`

**Change:** Replace manual notification workflow with automated workflow documentation.

**Before (lines 38-59):**
```markdown
## Notifying Subscribers

When publishing a **new** blog post (not edits to existing posts):

1. Push the new post to `main` branch
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Go to [Buttondown dashboard](https://buttondown.email/emails)
4. Click "New email"
5. Write notification:
   ```
   Subject: New post: [Post Title]

   Body:
   I just published a new post: [Post Title]

   [Brief 1-2 sentence description]

   Read it here: https://nicharena.com/blog/[slug]
   ```
6. Preview and send

**Important:** Only notify for new posts. Edits to existing posts (typos, clarifications) do not warrant notifications.
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Notifying Subscribers

Email notifications are **automated** via Buttondown's RSS-to-email feature.

**How it works:**
1. Push a new blog post to `main` branch
2. Site deploys and RSS feed updates at `https://nicharena.com/rss.xml`
3. Buttondown detects new item in feed (checks every ~30 minutes)
4. Subscribers receive email automatically

**Notes:**
- Only new posts trigger notifications (edits to existing posts don't re-appear in RSS)
- There may be up to 30-minute delay between deploy and email send
- To send manually or customize, use [Buttondown dashboard](https://buttondown.email/emails)
```

**Why:** Replaces manual workflow documentation with automated workflow. Explains the 30-minute delay inherent to RSS-to-email polling.

## Open Questions + Risk Areas

1. **Buttondown Username:** `nicharena` - account created, embed URL ready.

2. **DNS Propagation:** May take up to 48 hours after Cloudflare DNS changes. GitHub Pages won't provision SSL until DNS resolves correctly.

3. **Cloudflare Proxy Mode:** Must use "DNS only" (gray cloud), not "Proxied" (orange cloud). Proxied mode interferes with GitHub Pages SSL certificates.

4. **Subscriber Count API:** Need to verify if Buttondown free tier provides access. If not, Ticket #5 will be skipped.

5. **RSS-to-Email Delay:** Buttondown checks RSS feeds every ~30 minutes. Subscribers won't receive instant notifications - there may be up to 30-minute delay after deploy.

6. **RSS Feed on First Sync:** Must enable "Skip old items" in Buttondown to prevent sending emails for all existing blog posts when first connecting the feed.
