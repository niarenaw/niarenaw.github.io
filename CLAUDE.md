# Claude Code Instructions

## Blog Posts

When writing technical blog posts:

- **No prerequisites sections** - don't add "Prerequisites:" or similar preambles listing what readers should know
- **Spaced dashes** - use ` - ` not em dashes `—` (e.g., "simple to define - not complex")
- **No "Complete Code" sections** - code should be interleaved throughout, not dumped at the end
- **Single arrows in math** - use `\to` not `\Rightarrow` for sequence steps

See `.docs/BLOG_STYLE.md` for the full technical blog style guide.
